# Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion 🖼️🌌

Welcome to the Text-to-Image Generation project powered by Stable Diffusion and Streamlit! 
This project allows you to generate stunning images from text prompts using advanced AI models.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elliottbarnes/text_to_image_w_stable_diffusion.git
   cd text_to_image_w_stable_diffusion
   ```
   
2. **Setup Environment:**

   - Create a new conda environment (optional but recommended)
  
   ```bash
   conda create -n text-to-image python=3.10
   conda activate text-to-image
   ```
   
   - Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
   
   ```bash
   streamlit run generate_image_streamlit.py
   ```

4.  **Generate Images:**
   - Enter a text prompt in the Streamlit interface and click "Generate".
